# Recommender-Systems
This repo is about developing and configuring parameters of Recommender System for Book-Crossing Dataset. 
Predicting ratings for books according to input data. Two approaches were used for this task:
    
    1) Matrix Factorization
    2) Neural Network with Transformer Encoder layers

The best results of Transformer are:
    
    - AP@K: k=9, AP=1.0;
            k=20, AP=0.83
    - MSE: 1.228 (in 10-point system)
    - RMSE: 2.62
